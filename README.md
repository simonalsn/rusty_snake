Rusty snake is a snake game written in rust.

I've tried to make something that will be fun to play, and have some features to distinguish it from vanilla snake, even though it is mostly a testbed for LLM code generation.

It has mostly been used as a testbed to see how complex code I can get various AIs to write, with minimal inteference from me except for descrubung what I want and copying back error messages, when the code does not compile.

When I started this repo, the current version have been written by chatgpt o1-preview.
I tried to expand it using o1-mini, but it did not work, not sure if it is because of the mini model or because this was the same point where the code just got too complex for either model.

I will probably update/expand the game later.
